# notes:
# torch and torch vision can yield errors sometimes so i recommend you install them separately
# pip install torch torchvision
# same with ray[tune]
# pip install 'ray[tune]'

# there is a slight change that u may need to install additional packages sometimes I just be installing them on the fly
